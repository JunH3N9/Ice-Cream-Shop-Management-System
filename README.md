# Ice cream shop management system project
Year 1 assignment for PRG2 (C# programming). I was tasked to make a simple application for a mock ice cream shop. My application provides a display menu with all available features: 
1. List all customers
2. List all current orders
3. Register new customers
4. Take an order of a customer
5. Display the order details of a customer
6. Modify the order details
7. Process an order and checkout
8. Display monthly ant total charged amounts breakdown for the year

Through this assignment, I improved my C# skills as I aimed to make my code as efficient as possible. I learned how to better implement classes and functions, as well as work as a pair with my groupmate.
